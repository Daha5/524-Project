    "When scheduling classes for a semester at UW-Madison, a lot of options are presented; even after having selected which courses you would like to take, you still need to find a combination of discussion sections, lectures, and labs which both is possible to do, and works well for your extra cirricular schedule. The first part of this problem is sovled by the UW-Madison Schedule Planner, which will take your selected courses and generate a list of schedules which have all of the courses you selected without any overlap (if possible). However, due to the wide variety of times for discussion sections and lectures for a course, and only needing to take one of them a large number of potential schedules may be available. This can result in hundreds of possible schedules with no way to easily sort through them or determine which is the best for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "While \"which is best\" varies from person to person, there are a few things that are often targeted by students when looking for a schedule. One of the things that makes one schedule better than another is the starting time of the first class and the ending time of the last class. Some people like to group their classes all in the morning to get them out of the way, and have their afternoons as free as possible, while others like to sleep in and would rather their day start later and might care less about when their final class gets done (within reason!). Another consideration is the time taken between classes. While there is no general consenous on how much free time should be had in between classes, almost everyone can agree that a gap of 5 minutes between classes is too short, and should therefore be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our model, we attempt to optimize class selection, keeping these in mind to find the \"best\" possible schedule for a selection of courses. We will be using data from the UW-Madison course guide for the Fall 2017 semester. In order to generate a large number of possible schedules, we have selected five classes with lots of options for discussion sections and lectures, representing a possible freshmen-level courseload. The classes are Agronomy 100, Comp Sci 240, Math 320, Philosophy 101, and Philosophy 210. Using the UW-Madison scheduling tool, this gives a total of 608 viable schedules assuming every class had seats available."

    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **I will be running your code**. I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution.
