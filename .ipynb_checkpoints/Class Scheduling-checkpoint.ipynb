    "When scheduling classes for a semester at UW-Madison, a lot of options are presented; even after having selected which courses you would like to take, you still need to find a combination of discussion sections, lectures, and labs which both is possible to do, and works well for your extra cirricular schedule. The first part of this problem is solved by the UW-Madison Schedule Planner, which will take your selected courses and generate a list of schedules which have all of the courses you selected without any overlap (if possible). However, due to the wide variety of times for discussion sections and lectures for a course, and only needing to take one of them a large number of potential schedules may be available. This can result in hundreds of possible schedules with no way to easily sort through them or determine which is the best for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "While \"which is best\" varies from person to person, there are a few things that are often targeted by students when looking for a schedule. One of the things that makes one schedule better than another is the starting time of the first class and the ending time of the last class. Some people like to group their classes all in the morning to get them out of the way, and have their afternoons as free as possible, while others like to sleep in and would rather their day start later and might care less about when their final class gets done (within reason!).\n",
    "\n",
    "With our model, we attempt to optimize class selection, keeping these in mind to find the \"best\" possible schedule for a selection of courses. We will be using data from the UW-Madison course guide for the Fall 2017 semester. In order to generate a large number of possible schedules, we have selected five classes with lots of options for discussion sections and lectures, representing a possible freshmen-level courseload. The classes are Comp Sci 240, Math 320, Philosophy 101, and Philosophy 210. Using the UW-Madison scheduling tool, this gives a total of over 1000 viable schedules assuming every class had seats available."

    "Our first result that we printed (BASIC SCHEDULE) was a standard optimized schedule that does the purpose of the current UW Schedule Planner. It avoids conflicts with other classes and makes sure that all classes one signs up for are in the schedule, including one lecture and one discussion. \n",

    "### 4.C LATE BEGINNINGS\n",
    "After optimizing our schedule for a student who would like to start their classes as late as possible we get the schedule below.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see our results give us clear schedules based off of the preference of the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations / Issues with this model.\n",
    "When accounting for either late starts or early end times, this model does so for every class on a given day. This means that, for example, if you had 4 classes in the morning on some day ending at 9, 10, 11, and 12, it would take into account each of their end times, when the only one you may be concerned with is the last end time in a given day. A similar problem exists for start times. This means that there is the potential that this model does not produce a truly *optimal* schedule for making your days end as early as possible/start as late as possible. However, from the results generated, it appears to be a good way to find a schedule that is at least more preferable than manually digging through thousands of other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of the problem, it is hard to get results that have much practical meaning when relaxing any constraints, as all of the constraints are essential to creating valid schedules. One such issue we found early in our testing was that without enforcing that you don't take two lectures, our model will produce schedules where you skip out on a discussion to take another lecture."

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--Summarize your findings and your results, and talk about at least one possible future direction; something that might be interesting to pursue as a follow-up to your project.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings gave us viable schedule options for students who want to specialize their schedule for their own specific lifestyle. Whether its to sleep in and attend courses later in the day or to get all their courses out of the way as early in the day as possible, our project allows them to choose their preference. We did this by taking in data directly from the MyUW course guide, creating a schedulizer that found a schedule for a student taking our sample classes, one avoids conflicts and includes all necessary times for that class, and finally adding functions that use the classes start and end times in order to find a best fit for that student based on his or her preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible future direction would be to add a feature that would detect the location of where a certain class is and factor that in to the time between classes. The reason that is sometimes a problem is because the current UW Schedule Planner can give you a class that start 5 minutes after a previous class ends, without factoring in the 15 minute walk between buildings, and thus students end up being late to their second class or leaving early from their first class. Future work would include an optimizer taking into account the location for each class, calculating the distance between two consecutive classes, and constraining this distance to be walkable at an average human walking speed (about 3.1 miles per hour according to TranSafety, Inc) within the alotted time for those classes."
